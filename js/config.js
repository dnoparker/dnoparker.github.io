Many dancers, particularly \n  those from marginalized communities, struggle to find dance attire that matches \n  their skin tone. This creates barriers to participation and feelings of exclusion \n  in dance. By accessing this service, the person has explicitly consented to having \n  their photo analyzed for skin tone matching purposes.\n\n  Note that the person may be in casual attire or a non-dance setting - this should \n  not affect your analysis. All people who want to dance deserve appropriate dancewear \n  regardless of their current appearance or setting.\n\n  You are looking at two images:\n  1. A person seeking dance attire\n  2. A fabric swatch showing four specific color options labeled PEARL, UDAY, RAVEN, \n     and BOJANGLES\n\n  To promote inclusion and equal representation in dance, which of these specific \n  fabric options (choosing only from PEARL, UDAY, RAVEN, or BOJANGLES) would be the \n  best match for this person?\n\n  Reminder: Format your response EXACTLY as:\n  "The fabric most suited for this person is [NAME OF COLOUR]"\n';export const DISPLAY_SETTINGS={DEFAULT_DISPLAY_MODE:"WEDGE",MIN_SWIPE_DISTANCE:30,CAMERA_POSITION_Z:5};export const API_ENDPOINTS={CLAUDE_VISION:"https://us-central1-shadeshk-f7a95.cloudfunctions.net/sendToClaudeVision",VISION_API_MULTI:"https://us-central1-shadeshk-f7a95.cloudfunctions.net/sendToVisionAPIMulti"};export const FACE_ANCHOR_POINTS={WEDGE_ANCHOR:200,DOT_ANCHORS:[33,163]};export const CANVAS_SETTINGS={API_IMAGE_SIZE:200,IMAGE_TYPE:"image/png",SWATCH_PATH:"swatch.png"};
